# Coral Reef Benthic Cover Data Analysis

This repository contains a bioinformatics project analyzing coral reef benthic cover data. The analysis applies data science and statistical methods to uncover benthic community structures, investigate correlations among benthic components, and visualize spatial and environmental trends.

## Project Files

- `Coral_Reef_Benthic_Cover_Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with all analysis and visualizations.
- `benthic_cover_joined.csv` — Coral reef benthic cover dataset used for the analysis.


## Main Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of coral reef ecological data.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans clustering to identify benthic community types.
- Visualization of PCA results and clusters.
- Correlation heatmap of benthic cover variables.
- Summary statistics and insights on benthic cover composition.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

```
pip install notebook numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```


## Data Source

Benthic cover data obtained from publicly available coral reef monitoring datasets.
